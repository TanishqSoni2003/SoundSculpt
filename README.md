## Setup
### Local environment
Create a new environment with Python 3.10 and install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
set the `PYTHONPATH` to the root folder:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=path/to/SoundSclupt
```
download the vocal remover model:
```bash
wget --progress=bar:force:noscroll https://huggingface.co/tanishq02/baseline_vocal_remover/blob/main/baseline.pth
```
then run the app with:
```bash
streamlit run app/header.py
```
### Docker
You can also run the app with Docker:
```bash
docker build -tSoundSculpt .
docker run -it --rm -p 7860:7860 $(DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME)
```
or pull the image from Hugging Face Spaces:
```bash
docker run -it -p 7860:7860 --platform=linux/amd64 \
	registry.hf.space/fabiogra-moseca:latest
```

You can set the following environment variables to limit the resources used by the app:
- ENV_LIMITATION=true
- LIMIT_CPU=true

### (Optional) Preprocess samples
If you want to preprocess the samples used in the demo, you need to set the env variable `PREPARE_SAMPLES=true` as a secret (create the file `run/secrets/PREPARE_SAMPLES` with `true` value inside).

If you run locally you also need to move the files inside `scripts` to the root folder and run `prepare_samples.sh`.
```
cp scripts/ .
chmod +x prepare_samples.sh
python prepare_samples.sh
```
